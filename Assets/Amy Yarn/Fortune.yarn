title: Fortune
---
I: Hello there, wandering traveler!

A: Hello.

I: Surely you would like your fortune told for the reasonable price of 3 silver coins?

A: Hmm...

Pay 3 silver coins for your fortune?
  -> Yes
    A: Sure, I'll hear my fortune.
    I: Excellent!
    I: Allow me to peer into my crystal ball...
  -> No
    A: No, not today.
    I: Very well, as you wish.
 
That's it for now!
