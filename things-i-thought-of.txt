is it fine that statusscript dragged dialoguesystem and vice versa?
advance dialogue when click anywhere, not just Continue
later add full name, character image
give the background an image

get at least a simple pixel art generator on my computer [eg. quick cutscene background generation]
default pivot to Sprite Editor > bottom center, Inspector > Sprite Renderer > sprite sort point to bottom center
do i need to put inventoryconsts inside StatusScript so it runs? does it have to be in the hierarchy to run?
