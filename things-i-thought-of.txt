fix the PInteractCollider to be a list and not 1 object

dialogue:
isadora conversation reduce 3 silver coins / add 1 support pt (and possibly be slightly different if replay)
advance dialogue when click anywhere, not just Continue
later add full name, character image
give the background an image (aesth)

box: 
add stardew navigation (i think esc to exit?) 
ofc, move items around (and eventually to other inventories)
omg need duplicates :O 

default pivot to Sprite Editor > bottom center, Inspector > Sprite Renderer > sprite sort point to bottom center
font background transparent not

(aesth)
learn how to make bars: water, energy
money icon
make the water shake a little bit when you use it

do i need to put inventoryconsts inside StatusScript so it runs? does it have to be in the hierarchy to run? YES
is it fine that statusscript dragged dialoguesystem and vice versa? IS OK
